    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part</p>
    <p>of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you</p>
    <p>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more <a href="#">information about important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility &hyphen; as long as the subjects fall</p>
    <p>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</p>
    <p>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</p>
    <p>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>
            <p>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>°</sup>C (86<sup>°</sup>F), when the</p>
            <p>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</p>
        </li>
        <li> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the</p>
    <p>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,</p>
    <p>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</p>
            <p>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</p>
            <p>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</p>
            <p>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</p>
            <p>modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</p>
            <p>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</p>
            <p>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</p>
            <p>because they were really cold.</p>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
